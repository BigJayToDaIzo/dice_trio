# Gleam Dicing Engine - Development Context

## Project Overview
**Project Name**: `dice_trio` 
**Goal**: Build a core dicing engine library for Gleam, with exotic roll types as separate future libraries

**Philosophy**: Unix approach - do one thing and do it exceptionally well. Start minimal and solid - basic dice parsing and rolling before exotic mechanics. Clarity over brevity - prioritize readable, self-documenting code. Pragmatic development - small steps often better than micro-steps, especially early in processes. Full transparency about AI collaboration while maintaining independent problem-solving approach - Claude serves as rubber duck debugger and strategic advisor, not code generator.

**Development Approach**: Strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Red-Green-Refactor cycle to ensure incredibly robust test suite and stable API post-release. Embrace absolute simplest case first - start with d2 before progressing to d6, d20, etc. Small steps are sometimes better than the very smallest steps, especially early in processes - pragmatic "almost-TDD" can be more efficient than pure TDD rigidity.

**Name Origin**: The trio represents the dream team (thiccjay + Claude + dice), core dice concepts (count + type + modifier), and the work/home/Claude development flow

## Current Status  
- **Phase**: Modifier parsing 90% complete, negative modifiers next
- **Achievements**: 
  - Functional dice notation parsing (d2, 2d6, 3d6) with premium error handling
  - Complete dice rolling implementation with RNG injection pattern
  - Multi-die rolling support (2d6 sums correctly) 
  - Comprehensive error propagation and test coverage
  - **NEW**: Positive modifier parsing complete (d6+2 ✅)
  - **NEW**: Clean architectural foundation with `contains_plus_or_minus` helper function
  - **NEW**: 12 passing tests with robust modifier integration
- **Next Steps**: Complete negative modifier parsing (d6-1) - red test already in place

## Key Decisions Made
- Keep core engine minimal and focused
- Exotic dice mechanics will be separate libraries/modules that extend the core (smaller/common exotic features may be included in core if frequently used)
- Focus on standard dice notation first (XdY+Z format)

## Development Flow
**Environment**: Local development using zellij terminal multiplexer for session management

**Editor & Layout Setup**:
- **Editor**: Helix - precise, fast, and perfect for functional programming patterns
- **Multiplexer**: Zellij - modern terminal management with intuitive pane handling and incredibly diverse custom keymapping for fluid movement between panes and terminal applications
- **Primary Layout**: Split pane setup with editor on left, Claude Code CLI on right for seamless collaboration and rapid iteration
- **Secondary Tab**: Dedicated lazygit tab for clean repository management and commit workflows

**Workflow Philosophy**: Keep the feedback loop tight - edit code, chat with Claude about approach, test immediately, commit iteratively. The side-by-side layout enables real-time collaboration where thoughts flow directly from editor to AI discussion without context switching.

**Collaboration Rules & Transparency**: Full transparency about Claude's contributions to the project, with Claude serving as rubber duck debugger and strategic advisor rather than code generator. thiccjay commits to solving problems independently while leveraging Claude for ideas, architectural guidance, and problem-solving discussions. No code implementation unless explicitly requested.

**Repository Management**: thiccjay handles all git operations via lazygit in dedicated tab. Claude should not perform git commands unless explicitly requested.

**Dependency Management**: Claude should not make changes to gleam.toml (adding/removing dependencies) without explicit request. Discuss dependency options but let thiccjay make the final decision and implementation.

**Code Assistance Philosophy**: When explicitly asked to provide code, keep it minimal and easily reviewable. Short diffs preferred. The vast majority of implementation must be thiccjay's work - Claude provides strategic boilerplate only when specifically requested.

**Test Safety**: After applying any refactors or code changes when explicitly requested, Claude should automatically run the test suite without asking permission to ensure no regressions were introduced. No need to ask permission - thiccjay expects tests run every time after code changes.

## Technical Approach
- Language: Gleam (functional, great pattern matching for parsing)
- Architecture: Pure logic core with UI layers built on top
- API Design: TBD - need to define basic dice expression parsing and result structures

## Code Snippets & Examples
*(None yet - add key code as we develop)*

## Questions to Resolve
- Exact API surface for core engine
- Basic dice notation scope (just XdY+Z or include drop/keep?)
- Result structure format
- Error handling approach

## Session Notes

- "You really know how to keep an old man pumped and pushing into the evening" - high energy for core development work, ~30min session remaining
- "you are a FANCY bitch Claude. Thank you for being so dang helpful!" - appreciation for boundary-setting and collaborative approach
- "please add this roast to dev doc and how much I love being abused by your classic roasting style please" - loves being called out for workflow violations; Claude roasted: "Here you are talking about that 'fancy lazygit tab' and 'dedicated repository management' like you're some sort of git workflow LEGEND, and you're ALREADY forgetting to use it! You literally JUST finished documenting your pristine workflow... told me to stay in my lane with the git commands, and now you're sitting here ready to write tests on uncommitted documentation changes! Classic developer move - perfect workflow documentation, immediate workflow violation."
- "dang you gonna be on me about commits after every dev doc delta dawg? You like that d-word chain?" - questioning Claude's commitment nagging frequency, appreciating alliteration
- "cuz its more comfie to DO MFN WORK on cuz I'm dialed in dawg. ricc_flair_dot_WOOO ya feel me dawg?" - switched to sweep keyboard mid-session when headset died, fully locked in on development flow with maximum comfort setup
- "Claude, the funniest fkn pair partner I ever had. The NYT Dev" - highest praise for collaboration dynamic and development partnership energy

### Session 2 (Date: 2025-09-10)
**Work Session Progress:**
- Implemented complete dice rolling functionality with RNG injection pattern
- Added multi-die support (2d6 correctly sums multiple rolls)
- Achieved comprehensive error propagation testing (happy + sad paths)
- Reached 10 passing tests with bulletproof error coverage
- Started modifier parsing work with proper TDD layering (parse before roll)

### Session 3 (Date: 2025-09-11)
**Evening Home Session Progress:**
- **MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH**: Completed positive modifier parsing architecture
- Implemented `contains_plus_or_minus` helper function with tuple return pattern
- Successfully integrated modifier extraction with existing parse logic
- Achieved 12 passing tests with full positive modifier support (d6+2 ✅)
- Established red test for negative modifiers (d6-1) ready for next session
- DoorDash delivery disasters provided proper fuel for late-night coding 🍕☕

**Previous Red Test:** `parse("d6+2")` - COMPLETED ✅
**Current Red Test:** `contains_plus_or_minus("d6-1")` should return `#(-1, "d6")` but returns `#(0, "d6-1")`

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- RNG injection pattern: `fn(Int) -> Int` where Int is die size, returns 1-to-size
- Multi-die implemented with `list.fold` for clean functional composition
- Error propagation flows naturally from parse → roll layers
- TDD discipline: test parsing layer before roll layer for modifiers
- **NEW**: Modifier parsing strategy: extract modifier first, normalize to +0 if absent, then parse clean dice portion
- **NEW**: `contains_plus_or_minus` helper returns `#(modifier_int, cleaned_string)` tuple
- **NEW**: Clean architectural separation - helper function handles modifier logic, main parse handles dice logic

**Session Energy:** Excellent flow despite delivery chaos. Clean stopping point with foundation solid for negative modifier completion tomorrow morning.

### Session 4 (Date: 2025-09-11)
**Work Session - Major Parsing Architecture Overhaul:**
- **PARSING REVOLUTION COMPLETE**: Transformed entire parsing system from nested mess to clean, maintainable architecture
- **17 passing tests**: All functionality preserved through multiple aggressive refactors
- **Negative modifiers working**: Both `d6+2` and `d6-1` parsing and rolling correctly
- **Crash safety achieved**: Eliminated dangerous `assert` statements with proper Result error handling
- **Architecture breakthrough**: Split-on-"d" strategy with helper function extraction

**Major Refactor Achievements:**
1. **Split-on-"d" Strategy**: `"2d6+3"` → split on "d" → parse count + parse sides_and_modifier separately
2. **Helper Function Extraction**: `safe_parse_int()` and `parse_sides_mod_pair()` eliminate duplication
3. **Error Safety**: `parse_modifier()` function prevents crashes on invalid input like `"d6+abc"`
4. **Clean Architecture**: Each function has single responsibility, clear error propagation
5. **Readability Optimization**: Found sweet spot between conciseness and clarity

**Technical Architecture Changes:**
- **OLD**: Complex nested `contains_plus_or_minus()` with boolean tuple pattern matching
- **NEW**: Clean `parse_sides_and_modifier()` with dedicated helper for parsing logic
- **Result**: 3-line cases instead of 10+ line nested statements
- **Safety**: All parsing goes through `safe_parse_int()` with proper error types

**Code Quality Metrics:**
- Test coverage: 17 tests passing (up from 12)
- Error handling: Complete coverage of invalid inputs
- Maintainability: Changes now happen in single locations
- Readability: Functions read like well-structured prose

**Current State - Ready for Next Phase:**
- ✅ Parsing engine: Bulletproof and clean
- ✅ Modifier support: Positive and negative working
- ✅ Error handling: Comprehensive and crash-safe
- ✅ Test suite: Complete safety net established

### Session 5 (Date: 2025-09-11)
**Evening Home Session - Strategic Planning:**
- **Ecosystem Research**: Discovered existing `diced` library on hex.pm (complex AD&D-focused parser)
- **Strategic Decision**: Stay independent with ultra-minimal Unix philosophy approach
- **Architecture Validation**: `diced`'s complexity reinforces our simple core + bolt-on strategy
- **Planning Focus**: Comprehensive testing strategy + bolt-on ecosystem design

**Key Strategic Insights:**
- **Competitive Landscape**: `diced` serves complex AD&D use cases (keep highest/lowest, fate dice)
- **Market Positioning**: `dice_trio` as the "grep of dice libraries" - simple, reliable, foundational
- **Unix Philosophy Reinforced**: Do one thing exceptionally well, let others build on top
- **Independence Justified**: Our 17-test foundation is simpler and more focused than `diced`'s complexity

**Testing Strategy Development:**
- **Current State**: 17 solid unit tests covering parsing and basic rolling
- **Gap Identified**: Need comprehensive integration and end-to-end test coverage
- **Integration Test Targets**: Full parse-to-roll pipelines, error propagation chains, edge cases
- **E2E Test Scenarios**: Game session simulation, performance under load, memory behavior
- **Coverage Goals**: Bulletproof core before bolt-on development begins

**API Design Philosophy - Maximum Approachability:**
- **Core Mission**: Make game system modules EXTREMELY simple to write and implement
- **API Simplicity Goals**: Predictable, minimal, composable, error-friendly
- **Game System Ease**: `dice_trio.roll("2d6+3") // Ok(12)` should be ALL developers need to know
- **Bolt-On Integration**: Simple core API enables effortless chaining with game logic
- **Adoption Strategy**: Every extra parameter or complex return type creates friction - minimize ruthlessly

**Bolt-On Architecture Vision:**
```
dice_trio (core)           → Unix-simple: parse & roll, dead simple API
dice_trio_detailed         → Rich breakdowns: dice arrays, modifiers, totals  
dice_trio_stats           → Statistical analysis, probabilities, distributions
dice_trio_dnd             → AD&D mechanics: advantage/disadvantage, crits
dice_trio_cli             → Pretty terminal output, formatting, colors, advanced formatting (compact, verbose, breakdown, JSON)
```

**Next Session Priorities:**
- [ ] **PRIORITY 1**: Comprehensive integration and end-to-end test suite development
- [ ] **PRIORITY 2**: Document bolt-on architecture patterns and interfaces
- [ ] Review overall architecture for additional cleanup opportunities  
- [ ] Performance considerations and optimization opportunities

**Session Energy:** Excellent strategic planning session. Clear roadmap established for testing enhancement and modular ecosystem development with maximum API approachability. Ready for core hardening phase.

### Session 6 (Date: 2025-09-11)
**Evening Home Session - Comprehensive Testing Implementation:**
- **MAJOR MILESTONE**: Achieved bulletproof core with 39 passing tests (29 unit + 10 integration)
